      <b>Heyloo</b>, Just wanted to say how grateful I am for you. You’ve been so caring, fun, and honestly one of the nicest (also the most hard working) person I know :]
      Thanks for putting up with my rat behavior and being so amazing throughout the time we've known each other! <p><b> I wish you a birthday full of joy, and all the happiness you deserve 💝 </b>
